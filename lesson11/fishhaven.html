            <p>Once upon a time there was a girl who grew up in district twelve, a coal mining district. At an age too young she lost her father in a mining accident, and was left with the care of her family, as her mother did not handle loss of her husband well, and had sunk into a depression. Caring for herself, younger sister, and mother became her job, and to succeed she taught herself to hunt and gather food in the forest, a place illegal to venture. She was fairly matter-of-fact, coming off as mean at times, but she had a soft spot for her sister.</p>
            <p>When her sister was chosen to compete in a game of life and death, she quickly volunteered to take her sister's place. She was skilled, but without the help of her male counterpart in the game she would never have survived and made it home. They succeeded together, and the girl did return home to her sister, but her life was not what she had left behind before the games. She struggled and rebelled against the capital and eventually she won her freedom from the unbalanced society she had been raised in, but at a great cost. The one thing she cherished, the life of her sister, was lost in the quest to gain the country's freedom. What you probably don't know about this archer who you want to call Katniss, is that she is a real person who lives in Fish Haven.</p>
